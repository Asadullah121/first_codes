        What is HTML?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to
         be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style 
         Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript and VBScript.

        How does it Work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site
         author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed
          through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser
           reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.

        What is CSS?
    </h2>
    <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used
         to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you
          to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s 
          style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.

<div class="box-1">
    <h2>
        How does it Work?
    </h2>
    <p>
        When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information.
         It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is
          a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different
           browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
